```

## Mana

You can play soundeffect for each Mana point you have.
Mana replenishes regularly.

## Street Cred

Street Cred are a currency earn from chatting (you don't get more, for chatting
more), that you CAN ONLY GIVE AWAY. Give it away to other chatters you like, or

use it for deals, your choice!

Examples of Giving Away Street Cred:

```bash
!endorse @artmattdank
!bigups artmattdank
!props artmattdank 5
!props random 7
!props
!endorse
!bigups
```

## Cool Points

If someone gives you Street Cred it is converted to Cool Points.  Cool Points
can be used to buy, share, steal sounds. If you want Cool Points, you need
someone in the chat to give them to you!

Examples:

```bash
!buy !clap
!buy damn
!buy random
!steal clap beginbotbot
!share !clap @artmattdank
```

There are 800+ Soundeffects (and always climbing thanks to submissions from
viewers like yourself), which you can gain access to. All soundeffects are
managed in Git, and available at [Twitch Soundboard](https://github.com/davidbegin/twitch-soundboard).

### Share

You can share a command you have access to, if you have enough Cool Points.

```bash
!share !clap @artmattdank
```

This essentially duplicates ownership of the command with the other viewer.

### Steal

You can steal a command from someone else as well, and they will lose access
